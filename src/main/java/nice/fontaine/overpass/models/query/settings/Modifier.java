/**
 * Modifiers for derived information.
 *
 *  BOUNDING_BOX:   Adds the bounding box of each element to the element.
 *                  For nodes this is equivalent to "geom". For ways it is
 *                  the enclosing bounding box of all nodes. For relations
 *                  it is the enclosing bounding box of all node and way members,
 *                  relations as members have no effect.
 *  CENTER:         This adds the center of the above mentioned bounding box
 *                  to ways and relations. Note: The center point is not
 *                  guaranteed to lie inside the polygon.
 *  GEOM:           Add the full geometry to each object. This adds coordinates
 *                  to each node, to each node member of a way or relation,
 *                  and it adds a sequence of "nd" members with coordinates
 *                  to all relations.
 *  COUNT           Get the element count.
